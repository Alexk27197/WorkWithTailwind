# Nike Website with React & Tailwind 🏃‍♂️🌬️

Welcome to my demonstration of the Nike website, built with React and stylized using the power of Tailwind CSS. This project is a showcase of my abilities to integrate Tailwind CSS into a React application to create responsive and modern designs.

## Features 🛠

- **Modern UI**: The design closely resembles the contemporary aesthetics of Nike's branding.
- **Responsive Design**: The website gracefully adjusts to different screen sizes, ensuring an optimal experience across devices.
- **Powered by React**: Utilizes React for component-based architecture and efficient DOM updates.
- **Tailwind Integration**: Leverages Tailwind CSS for utility-based styles and responsive breakpoints.

## Technologies Used 🚀

- **React**: Handles the UI components and state management of the website.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Provides utility-first classes for rapid UI development without leaving the HTML.
- **Netlify**: Used for hosting and continuous deployment of the live demo.

## How It's Built ⚒️

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and then integrated with Tailwind CSS to provide the styling. The combination of React's component model and Tailwind's utility-first approach ensures a scalable and maintainable codebase.
